### Hi there, I'm Amy ðŸ‘‹

**Pronouns:**
_She/her_

ðŸŒ± I'm currently studying Data Science through a Data Science Bootcamp by CoGrammar.

ðŸ”­ I'm hoping to develop my knowledge and understanding of Python in order to start my career in Data Science, as well as build my portfolio to showcase what I'm capable of! ðŸ˜„

âš¡ Fun fact: I have 2 fluffy cats called âœ¨ Crumpet and Freyja âœ¨
